module ActivePublisher

  # 1. Introduce the idea of a durable retry should the RabbitMQ connection disconnect.
  # 2. Provide a higher-level pattern for fire-and-forget publishing.

  # @param [String] route The routing key to use for this message.
  # @param [String] payload The message you are sending. Should already be encoded as a string.
  # @param [String] exchange The exchange you want to publish to.
  # @param [Hash] options hash to set message parameters (e.g. headers).
